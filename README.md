# Creating a custom hook 
Created a custom hook "post-commit" in hooks of my git repository.<br>
added a script file which adds the commit message and timestamp to the commit-log.md everytime i commit.<br>
so when i commit the post-commit triggers.<br>
as i appended message&timestamp to the file everytime i commit the commit-log.md file contains all my commit messages along with respective time stamps.<br>
